# Hamming weight

This project/program calculates the Hamming weight of a number. The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from zero. E.g., 01234→4, 012012→4, 000050000→1.
It should also save the last string and should be able to return it (since the application was (re)started, no need to use a database).
